This guide walks through the basics of a _babe experiment. It is based on the Departure Point, a minimal example, which you can [obtain here](https://github.com/babe-project/departure-point) and [try out here](https://departure-point.netlify.com). The Departure Point is useful as a starting point of your own experiments.
