This guide walks through the basics of a _magpie experiment. It is based on the Departure Point, a minimal example, which you can [obtain here](https://github.com/magpie-ea/magpie-departure-point) and [try out here](https://magpie-departure-point.netlify.com). The Departure Point is useful as a starting point of your own experiments.
