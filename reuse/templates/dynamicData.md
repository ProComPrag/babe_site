## Reading data from the database

The [dynamic data template](https://github.com/magpie-ea/DynamicDataTemplate) shows examples of how to load data that is stored in a database from the _magpie server app into an experiment. This is particularly useful for dynamic experimental designs where later trials depend on data generated by earlier trials/participants. For example, the [iterated narration example](https://github.com/magpie-ea/IteratedNarration) uses this functionality to realize an experiment in which participants read and reproduce a story which could be a previous reproduction of another participant.
