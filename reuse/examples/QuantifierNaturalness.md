## Quantifier naturalness

Participants are presented with pictures of geometric shapes in two different colors. The proportion of shapes in each color varies across trials. Participants also read a sentence and rate the adequacy of the sentence as a description of the given picture. The sentences to be judged use different quantifying expressions. 

This example makes use of the [CanvasTemplate](https://github.com/magpie-ea/CanvasTemplate) to draw a random picture on each trial. It also uses a random assignment of participants to three different experimental groups, thus realizing a between-subjects design.
