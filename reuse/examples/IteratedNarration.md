## Iterated Narration

The [iterated narration example](https://github.com/magpie-ea/IteratedNarration) project implements a chain iterated story telling in which participants read a story and reproduce it for subsequent participants to read and reproduce. This partially replicates a classic study by Bartlett (1932), uses on of his original items and another item from a similar more recent study by Mesoudi & Whiten (2004).
