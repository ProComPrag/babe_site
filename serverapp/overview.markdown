The _magpie server app helps you store data from your experiments. You must install the server
app once before you can collect data. You can install it locally on your computer, e.g., for
use in a laboratory or in field experiments. This is useful when you do not have internet
connection during data collection. You can also install an online server version, which allows
you to collect data by providing your participants with a link or by recruiting participants
with crowd-sourcing platforms like Mechanical Turk or Prolific.
