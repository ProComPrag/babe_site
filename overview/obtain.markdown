Creating a browser-based experiment with _babe does not require installation of fancy software. You basically only need a recent browser and a text editor. Start by downloading a template, such as the [minimal
template](https://github.com/babe-project/MinimalTemplate). Then add elements from the list of examples or other templates (see the [resource section](../reuse/introduction.html)) and  modifying your experiment into the desired shape. Read the [getting started guide](../experiments/introduction.html) to find out more about the structure of a _babe experiment and how to use it to collect data.

If you want to use the _babe server app, either locally on your computer or on a server, you should follow the detailed [installation instructions in the docs](../serverapp/overview.html).
