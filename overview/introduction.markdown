_magpie provides help with three major aspects of online experiments: (i) designing your experiments and (ii) collecting and storing data from participants and (iii) recruiting participants for your experiment.

[_magpie experiments](../experiments/introduction.html) are provided as a conceptual framework, some convenience functions and many examples, so as to leave you all the freedom to create whatever your research goals demand.

The [_magpie server app](../serverapp/overview.html) offers ready-made but customizable functions for storing experimental data in a database. To be able to record data from a _magpie experiment with the _magpie server up you will need to install it, following the [installation instructions in the docs](../serverapp/02serverinstall.html).

_magpie provides convenience functions to help you collect data from participants in many ways. It only requires changing a few lines of code to either just share a link with your friends or students, post it as a HIT on Amazon's Mechanical Turk or recruit participants via Prolific. More on this is in the [data collection section](../datacollection/overview.html).
