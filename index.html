  <p> _babe provides a basic architecture for browser-based experiments. It offers a simple design template with great convenience functions and many fully worked out examples. You can quickly create behavioral experiments which run inside any modern browser, so that experiments can easily be shared with other researchers to promote your work and support open science.</p>

  <p> To collect the data from your experiments, _babe provides a server app with functionality for storing and retrieving the data from your experiments in a database. Thereby _babe allows for multiple methods of deployment without having to change the experiment itself. _babe makes it easy to use crowdsourcing platforms like Amazon's MechanicalTurk or Prolific to recruit participants.</p>
